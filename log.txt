when adding namespace to root, we need to handle nested, if we're in an open ns block.
so the ns name, will be its global name.
that is, parent ns's name, combined with `.` char.

nsPath does that. (based on blocks)

let prev = blocks.peek(-3) # -2*2+1
    if prev.isSome and prev.get.name == "NamespaceDeclaration":
      echo "PREV: " & $prev
      let prevNsName = extract(CsNamespace, prev.get.info).name
      if prevNsName != newns.name:
        newns.name = prevNsName & "." & newns.name
